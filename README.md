# Comprehensive-Analytics-Forecasting-for-GitHub-Repositories

Problem Statement:
The goal is to use GitHub to track created and closed issues of a given repository(angular, material-design, angular-cli,D3) for the past year along with timeseries forecasting using Tensorflow/LSTM Keras and we will then see how to deploy it to gcloud platform.

Solution:
We are creating three microservices:
        1. React 
        2. Flask
        3. LSTM/Keras
